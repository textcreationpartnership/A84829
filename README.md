#The trumpet of the Lord sounded, and his sword drawn, and the separation made between the precious and the vile; and the vineyard of the Lord dressed by his own husbandmen, and the dead trees cut down, and all the mystery of witchcraft discovered in all professions: by them who have come thorow great tribulation, whose garments have been washed in the blood of the lamb; who are accounted as the off-scowring of all things for Christs sake, scornfully called by the world Quakers.#
